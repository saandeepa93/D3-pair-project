    <h3>Visualization 1: Bar Chart</h3>
    <div><svg id="vis_1" name="vis_1" class="default_svg"></svg></div>
    <div>
        <p >
            <!-- Brief description of what the visualization is trying to show about the data.
            <b>How many surviving male and female passengers are there?</b>
            The above visualization is an attempt to show the comparison of survivors between the two genders. 
            The bar chart shows a contrasting difference in the number of survivors  with the number of female survivors
            almost the double of their counterpart. There are additional factors that contribute to this detail 
            that are shown in further visualizations. -->
        </p>
        <p >
            <!-- Brief description of the visualization, encoding, and embellishment rationale. -->
            <!-- The most basic bar chart has been used to visualize the since that is the most appropriate.
            The height of the bar chart represents the surviving population per gender. 
            Most of the times, simple data requires simple techniques without the need for "beautification". -->

        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Visualization 2: Scatter Plot</h3>
    <div><svg id="vis_2" name="vis_2" class="default_svg"></svg></div>
    <div>
        <p >
            <!-- Brief description of what the visualization is trying to show about the data. -->
            <!-- The above visualization is trying to answer two questions. -->
            <ul>
                <!-- <li><b>Was age a factor for survival during the titanic sinking?</b> This helps in understanding whether the 
                    physically healthy young adults were able to survive better compared to the older age group and
                    children. Clearly, the plots show no real difference in the survival across age groups.
                </li>

                <li><b>Was the fare price that people paid helped them survive? </b> This is basically assessing if the 
                passengers who were present in upper class were able to survive better. It can be clearly seen that 
                upper class passengers had a higher proportions of survivors, whereas, lower fair passengers had roughly equal
                proportions of survivors. The x-axis represents the age and the y-axis represents the Fare amount.
                </li> -->
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p >
            <!-- Brief description of the visualization, encoding, and embellishment rationale. -->
            <!-- When dealing with data which has numbers on continuous scale for all dimensions, scatter plots
            is the best way to represent. Although scatter plot does not give the precise values, italic
            prvoides a fuzzy detail in the overall data. Similarly, color encoding has been utilized to 
            indicate whether a data point (passenger) survived or not. 'y' axis ticks have been extended to
            represent different age groups. -->
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Visualization 3: Stacked and grouped bar chart</h3>
    <div><svg id="vis_3" name="vis_3" class="default_svg"></svg></div>
    <div>
        <p>
            <!-- Brief description of what the visualization is trying to show about the data. -->
            <!-- <b>What is the survival ratio among different genders for each ticket class?</b>
            The above visualization show the survival rate of different class per gender. Each 
            gender has a pair of stacked bar plots, which indicates non-surviving and 
            surviving passenger counts (left to right). Once again, this visualization 
            is an attempt to capture a much comprehensive representation of factors that correlates to 
            survival of a passenger. One key thing to note is the high number of non-surviving
            male passenger in the 3rd class ticket and the lowest number of non-surviving female passengers.
            in the 1st class. This might denote that the location for the passengers in the 
            3rd class might be the most unsafe place during sinking. -->

        </p>
        <p>
            <!-- Brief description of the visualization, encoding, and embellishment rationale. -->
            <!-- Grouped and stacked bar chart has been used to represent the numbers. Each gender is grouped with a pair of 
            stacked bar charts. These stacked bar charts are color encoded which denote the different class 
            in that category. The x-axis represent the gender and the y-axis represents the count of passengers in each category. -->

        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Visualization 4: Density plot/Heatmap</h3>
    <div><svg id="vis_4" name="vis_4" class="default_svg"></svg></div>
    <div>
        <p>
            <!-- Brief description of what the visualization is trying to show about the data. -->
            <!-- <b>Can heatmap give a better picture for vis 3 in determining the ticket class with different survival rate?</b>
            This is a density plot for to show the correlation between sex and class in the surviving.
            This plot corroborates the previous plot which clearly shows that the female survivors in teh first class 
            having a high count(color gradient). Similarly, the male passengers in the 2nd class had the lowest survival number.
            This should not be confused with the proportion shown in previous chart.  -->


            
        </p>
        <p>
            <!-- Brief description of the visualization, encoding, and embellishment rationale. -->
            <!-- The heatmap uses color gradient to represent survival count. Higher count is denoted by a stronger intensity of the 
            gradient. The x-axis represents the class of ticket and y-axis represents the sex. Unlike the 
            bar charts, the heatmap does not show precise numbers but rather and overview of the data/pattern. -->
